# [Calculator](https://stanleyjh.github.io/Calculator/)

This was my first Project. It was a challenge because this was the first time combining HTML, CSS, and JS. There were plenty of trial and errors in figuring out why things weren't working the way I expected. Overtime, I learned to write logs to the console to debug my code and see what was happening.
