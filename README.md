# Calculator

This was my first JavaScript Project. It was a challenge at first because this was the first time I was interweaving HTML, CSS and JS. There were many nights of head scratching trying to figure out why things weren't working the way I expected. Overtime, I was able to learn how to use Chrome DevTools and add console.logs to debug my code to see where things were or were not executing.
